# SQL Injection Prevention Module

## Inputs
The code consists of Python modules related to authentication, authorization, and Jinja2 template processing.
- `auth.py`: Contains functions for user authorization based on roles, as well as retrieving authorized users from a database.
- `jinja2.py`: Contains functions for generating CSRF tokens and processing authenticated users in templates.

## Outputs
The modules provide decorators and functions that can be used to enhance web application security by implementing user authentication and authorization checks, as well as CSRF token generation for preventing cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The `authorize` decorator can be used to protect routes based on user roles, and functions like `get_auth_user` can be utilized to retrieve authenticated users. Additionally, the `csrf_processor` and `auth_user_processor` functions can be used in Jinja2 templates to handle CSRF tokens and authenticated user data during rendering.
