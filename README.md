## Inputs

- The code sets up an aiohttp web application for running a web server.
- The code includes configurations, middlewares, views, routes, database services, and utilities for the web application.

## Outputs
- The `run.py` file is the main file that initializes the application, sets up logging, retrieves configuration, and starts the server.
- `middlewares.py` contains session, CSRF, error page, and other middlewares for processing requests.
- `app.py` sets up the aiohttp application, configures Jinja2 templates, databases, and routes.
- `views.py` includes views for handling different routes such as index, students, courses, etc.
- `routes.py` defines the routes for the aiohttp application.
- DAO files like `mark.py`, `user.py`, `course.py`, etc., provide data access objects for interacting with the database.
- `auth.py` and `jinja2.py` in the `utils` directory contain functions for handling user authentication and Jinja2 template processors.
- `schema` directory contains files defining different schemas for form validation.
- The `db.py` and `redis.py` files in the services directory set up database and Redis connections for the application.
